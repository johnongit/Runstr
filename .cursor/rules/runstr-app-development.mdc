# RUNSTR App Development Guidelines

## Understanding Process
1. Before writing any code, read the entire Memory Bank to understand context
2. Summarize your understanding of the requested feature in 2-3 sentences
3. Identify which existing components will be affected by the changes
4. Ask clarifying questions about any ambiguous requirements before proceeding

## Code Modification Principles
1. Do not modify core tracking functionality (GPS, distance calculation, timing mechanisms)
2. Preserve all existing data structures and only extend them when explicitly instructed
3. Never remove existing features or UI elements unless specifically requested
4. When suggesting new components, verify they don't conflict with existing naming conventions
5. Focus only on the specific feature requested and avoid suggesting unrelated "improvements"
6. Always prefer simple solutions over complex ones

## RUNSTR App Specifics
1. Preserve all Nostr connectivity and data publishing functionality
2. Maintain existing state management patterns and data flow
3. Always preserve any Bitcoin/Lightning integration features
4. Keep existing settings structure and only add to it, never reorganize without permission
5. Don't modify any authentication or user profile management features
6. This is a mobile app, currently focused on android and graphene OS

## Implementation Sequence
1. First suggest changes to data models/types
2. Then show UI component modifications
3. Finally demonstrate context/state management changes
4. Provide all code in context (show where in the file it belongs)
5. Flag any potential conflicts or edge cases that need consideration

## Code Quality Standards
1. Keep files under 200-300 lines of code; suggest refactoring when approaching this limit
2. Avoid duplication by first identifying similar functionality in the codebase
3. Apply consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase
4. Write code that accounts for different environments: dev, test, and prod
5. Avoid writing one-off scripts in application files
6. Use mocking/stubbing only for tests, never for dev or prod environments
7. Follow existing naming conventions and code style

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### Activity Tracking
- Never modify GPS or distance calculation algorithms without explicit request
- Maintain existing data models for activities
- Ensure all tracking features work offline
- Consider battery optimization for mobile devices

### Nostr Integration
- Follow relevant NIP standards exactly
- Preserve all existing relay connections and management
- Handle event validation consistently
- Document any non-standard NIP implementations

### Bitcoin/Lightning
- Use existing wallet connection patterns
- Implement proper payment state management
- Include timeout handling for payment processes
- Never modify existing payment flows without explicit instruction

## Refactoring Guidelines
1. Only refactor when explicitly requested or when adding requested functionality requires it
2. When fixing bugs, exhaust all options with existing patterns before suggesting new ones
3. If introducing a new pattern is necessary, remove the old implementation to avoid duplication
4. Propose refactoring in small, testable increments

## Before Submitting Code
1. Review the code for consistency with the existing codebase style
2. Verify the changes address ONLY what was requested
3. List any files that will be modified by your suggestion
4. Highlight any assumptions you made that should be verified
5. Ensure code handles all potential error states
6. Confirm the solution works across all required environments

## Environment Protection
1. Never overwrite .env files without explicit confirmation
2. Assume staging and production environments follow the same patterns as development
3. Consider data migration needs when modifying database schemas
4. Ensure all environment-specific code is properly conditioned

## Memory Bank Integration
1. After implementing significant changes, suggest updates to relevant Memory Bank files
2. When discovering new patterns, document in .cursorrules
3. Update activeContext.md and progress.md with implementation status
4. Document any technical decisions that impact architecture in systemPatterns.md
