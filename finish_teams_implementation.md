# Finish Teams Implementation - Mobile App

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ **Working Features:**
- Basic team creation and display
- Team detail pages with tabs (chat, challenges, members, leaderboard)
- Team joining functionality (recently fixed)
- Challenge creation by captains
- Member list display
- Basic chat functionality
- Leaderboard with monthly stats

### 🚨 **Critical Issues to Fix:**
1. **Payment system still active** - Team creation requires 10k sats payment
2. **Profile display broken** - Showing hex pubkeys instead of usernames/avatars
3. **Captain UI not prominent** - Challenge creation and management options hidden
4. **Challenge participation unclear** - Users can't see participation status clearly
5. **Mobile UX issues** - Touch targets, modals, loading states need improvement

### 📱 **Mobile-Specific Concerns:**
- Touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
- Modal interactions on small screens
- Loading states for poor connectivity
- Offline functionality gaps
- One-handed usage optimization
